# Terraform-Practical

# Modules

1. In the Terraform, a module is like a container that holds a set of related resources and configurations together.
2. A module consists of a collection of .tf and/or .tf.json files kept together in a directory.

# Why we use modules in terraform?

1. Reusability: You can use the same module in multiple places. Using modules can save time and reduce costly errors by re-using configuration written by you or 
   another member.
2. Collaboration: Modules make it easier for teams to work together, as each team can develop and maintain their own modules.
3. Abstraction: Modules hide the complexity of the resources and configurations inside, making it easier to manage and understand your infrastructure.
4. Organization: Modules help keep your code tidy by grouping related resources and configurations into a single unit.
5. Security and Compliance: Modules can encapsulate security and compliance practices.
